# Selection Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates the selection sort algorithm. The program generates a list of 1000 random numbers and sorts them using the selection sort method. It also measures the execution time of the sorting process.

## Program Overview

The primary purpose of this program is to showcase the implementation of the selection sort algorithm. Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and putting it at the beginning.

## Code Structure

### Files
- `selection_sort.py`: Main Python script containing the selection sort algorithm.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

### Functions
- `selectionSort(lst)`: Implements the selection sort algorithm on the given list.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   python selection_sort.py
   ```

3. **Output:**
   - The sorted list will be displayed.
   - The execution time of the sorting process will be printed.

## Note

Feel free to explore and modify the code based on your requirements. This simple program serves as an educational example of the selection sort algorithm in Python.

Happy coding!
